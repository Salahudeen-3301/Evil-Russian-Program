# Evil-Russian-Programme

I was inspired to create this pushup fitness trainer project after seeing a video about "The Evil Russian Program". It is a fitness program created to increase the amount of pushups  you can do by up to 170% in two weeks! It involves doing the maximum amount of pushups possible until exhaustion, and doing a perecentage of that amount everyday for two weeks with  varying time intervals in between.

 WARNING:You will need to pause all upper body workouts until the end of a fortnight. You should stop an hour before sleeping to sleep comfortably.
